# Social-media-network-model-for-identifying-enterprise-attributes

## Introduction
Comments made on social media networks, including positive or negative sentiments from customers, influence that enterpriseâ€™s 
success or failure in the marketplace. Enterprises use social media networks as low-cost and real-time information sources for 
discovering customer sentiment and what attributes attract customers. The authors of this work present enterprise decision support 
systems in which decision makers can consider the real-world effects of customer feedback and sentiment extracted from social media data. 

## Contribution
In our method, Co-occurrence network analysis is exploited to discover enterprise attributes. In summary, our contributions are 
1.  Generate freguent n-grams from collected twitter data.
2.  Generate a weighted adjacency matrix, which is a co-occurrence matrix among the keywords from the lists of n-grams.
3.  Based on the co-occurrence graph genereated from the matrix and its strongly connected components, graph a time series model for each clusters from the graph.
